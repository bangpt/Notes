NOTE
Some takeaways from Regex
1. The box []
• []: To denote the value for one character
i.e ac[abc] then we’re looking for one character after ac that value could be a or b or c
• Inside [] - is a range denote, it is a kind of short cut
• [] can stand anywhere
• It and the character before and/or after it makes the requirement complete, where and what
• [abc] is the same as [a|b|c]
• In the box space is denoted by a space [ ]
2. Quantifier
• In term of quantifier the [box] is 1
• 0 or 1: ?(Optional), banks? the char and ? is a requirement. It means there should be 0 or 1 (s)
• Like box it can stand anywhere
• Its position is for where, it and the char right in front of it is for what
• Similar qualifier: ? - 0 or 1, *: 0 or more whatever, +: (must) 1 or more, {n}: Exact (including the char in front of it)
, {n,m} - Range inside a exact quantifier
3. Negation [^] - Inside a box
• Means not that character specified in here, anything but
4. Combination of box [] and quantifier {}
• They can be combined and it totally makes sense
5. Alias or shorthand
\d: digit
\w: character, digit and underscore
\s: Space, newline, tab
\D: Not digit
\W: Not word
\S: Not space, newline or tab
6. DONT USE
.*: Match everything except newline as [^\n] .But the problem is newline character is different from flatform to flatform
7. Use escape char to find special character
8. Grouping. Use () for grouping, inside it we can use ‘or’ (|)
9. Boundary
• ^ for the beginning
• $ for the end
• \b for word boundary
10. Greediness - and non-greedyness ? (Yes it look like a optional qualifier but afer a repeation it just mean a non-greedy)
• When matching for repetion by default regex will try for as many text as possible
so put ? behind the repetion pattern to make it match the smallest possible. It can be after any repetion symbols

DONE
• Weekly and monthly report
IDEA
• I found a great idea of building a map of property & device in Excel and the script can look up there and generate the neccessary code
• It is simple but powerful and it is easy to maintain, check and can be versioning

— You should use while my ($key, $value) = each (%ahash) to access hash elements
— In regex the dot is to match against one character including spaces
— In regex use | for ‘or’ pattern after and before can be anything and can stand independently
— Range of charactors can be specified with — ie A-Z 1-4
— A set can be separated by , or not
