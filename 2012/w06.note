NOTE
{
   Way for finding in Perl array
   • The standard way is using grep
   • Counting

   Many of the uses of hashes are to "answer questions about lists." When you have an array or list of values and you need to ask about its properties, you will often find yourself using a hash. Start simply by counting the number of particular elements in a list. Here's the naïve approach:

       my $count = 0;
       for (@list) {
           $count++ if $_ eq "apple";
       }

   You can smarten this up with the use of the grep function:

       $count = grep $_ eq "apple", @list;


}
NOTE 
{
   Perl Hash
   • To check if the element exists exists($ahash{$aid})
   • To check if the value is available for that id
   defined $h{'foo'} ? print 1 : print 0;
   • Another way for the above case is 

   if ( $h{'foo'} ) {
        print 'true';
    }
    else {
        print 'false';
    }

}

17:00 - 17:30 INPROGRESS Setup private repositories for planner (in Python, Objective C) in Bitbucket
• Setting up through https seems to be the simplest method
Here are the steps
   1. Setup some basic global info
   $ git config --global user.name "Pham Thanh Bang"
   $ git config --global user.email "bangpt@youremail.com"
   2. Set proxy info for the enviroment
   Something like below is enough
   http_proxy=http://yourname:yourpass@proxy_address:proxy_port
   3. Add the repository user name, password to your project config file
   $ git remote add origin https://youraccountname:youraccountpass@github.com/youraccount/Notes.git
   or @bitbucket.org/bangpt/bpplanner.git
