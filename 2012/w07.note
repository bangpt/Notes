What I am doing now

10:00 - 11:15: DONE Refactoring the generator
   — We can create a annoynimous sub as
   $sub_ref = sub {print “Hello”};
   then with these scalar we can move to every where and execute there as &{$sub_ref}()
11:15 - 11:30: DONE English reading and conversation
NOTE
{
   — what have you got going on?
   — I guess I won't have a break until two o'clock
   — cut it close = to not leave enough margin, often occurs in the context of working against a deadline
   I thought it had its origins in tailoring as well, or carpentry, where if you cut too close to the line you've drawn you leave no margin for error--as in measure twice, cut once. Cut too close to the line and your work is wasted.

15:10: Thinking of way to simplify the naming
